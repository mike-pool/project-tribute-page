				<p id="tribute-info">On September 26th, 1983, Stanislav Petrov averted a nuclear strike by the Soviet Union on the United States. During a night watch, the early warning radar system he was monitoring indicated that the U.S. had launched multilpe nuclear missles at the Soviet Union. Petrov correctly determined that the readings were a false alarm, decidedly not informing his superiors, and the incident conclued there. Had he followed the established procedure and informed his superiors, it is quite likely the Soviet Union would have launched an actual nuclear missle attack on the United States, triggering a nuclear war.</p>
